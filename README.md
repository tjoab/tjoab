# Hey! I'm TJ - aka tjoab :wave:

 <h3> 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;About Me </h3>

I’m a data scientist and full-time curious human. I spend most of my days turning messy data into meaning, building cool ML apps, and occasionally yelling at my code like it’s a bad roommate (we always make up though).

🌍 Tools of the trade:
- Python (my forever Valentine)
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, XGBoost, PySpark, LangChain
- SQL, Postgres, SQLite
- And a sprinkle of React and JavaScript when needed

I also ship side projects that let me play with math, code, and creativity all at once, like:
- ✍️ A handwritten math-to-LaTeX translator (because typing equations is too mainstream)
- 🤖 A job finding bot that actually finds what you're looking for
- 🎯 A Wordle assistant powered by entropy (I may have taken Wordle too seriously)


When I’m not debugging something that *should* work, you’ll probably find me:
- Writing on my blog (tjoab.com) about whatever ML rabbit hole I fell into
- Teaching myself random things (currently: **reccomender systems**)
- Exploring elegant proofs or sketching out ideas I’ll probably over-engineer later
