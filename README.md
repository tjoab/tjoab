## Hey! I'm TJ - aka tjoab :wave:

👨🏻‍💻 *You've found my running log — a collection of tools I've built and ideas I've tested.*

I'm a data scientist with a background in statistics and math. I focus on turning messy, real-world data into reliable machine learning systems that solve meaningful problems. My work spans modeling, deployment, and experimentation — often blending structure with creativity to explore what's possible and what's practical.
